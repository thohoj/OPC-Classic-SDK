**Refreshing events**
---------------------

A client can get information on all active and inactive, non –
acknowledged conditions by using the **RefreshAeConditions** method of a
**AeSubscription** object.

This method can only be applied to condition – related events managed by
an AeSubscription object. A client could carry out a refresh call after
it has created its OPC object hierarchy in an already running Alarms and
Events Server, in order to get a current overview of all
condition-related events (alarm states). The server will then send the
event notifications which correspond to the filter of the AeSubscription
object to the client. The overview only contains the event last
occurred.

An outstanding refresh can be aborted by the client using a
**CancelRefreshAeConditions**.

For an example on how to call the RefreshAeConditions method check the
**AECondition** example.
