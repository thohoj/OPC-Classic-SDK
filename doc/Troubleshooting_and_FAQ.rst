“No content was found on your computer” when using F1 within VS2010
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To solve this problem follow the following steps:

-  Select **Help** menu item from VS2010 and select **Manage Help
   Settings**

-  Press OK button for using the default Library Location.

-  Run **Integrate Documentation into VS2010 help** batch file from
   Start menu/Softing OPC/Toolkit V44x

Recompile the toolkit binary components if your Visual Studio version is different by the ones listed below.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The delivered toolkit binaries are compiled using the Visual Studio
versions below:

============================ ============
**Development Environment**  **Version**
============================ ============
Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 7.1.6030
Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 8.0.50727.42
Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 9.0.30729.1
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 10.0.40219.1
Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 11.0.50727.1
Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 12.0.21005.1
Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 14.0.23107.0
Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 15.4.1
============================ ============

If you have another Visual Studio version installed on your computer we
suggest to recompile the toolkit binaries and use the resulted libraries
instead of the installed ones. Together with the Toolkit binaries you
should use the appropriate runtime binary files in your application
installation.

   The delivered OTB.dll respective OTBu.dll (delivered in ..\windows\bin\Legacy) are compiled with Visual Studio 
   2003 in release configuration and can be used without any modifications, except the case when the source code 
   license is used. These libraries are compiled on x86 target platform and can be used only for 32 bit applications.

After finishing the compilation of an application with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 an initialization error appears when loading the TBCVS2005.dll
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It might look like this: ‘LDR: LdrpWalkImportDescriptor() failed to
probe
c::raw-latex:`\program `files:raw-latex:`\softing`:raw-latex:`\OpcToolkit`:raw-latex:`\V`44x:raw-latex:`\windows`:raw-latex:`\c+`+:raw-latex:`\samples`:raw-latex:`\client`:raw-latex:`\daconsole`:raw-latex:`\bin`:raw-latex:`\vs2005`:raw-latex:`\win32`:raw-latex:`\release`:raw-latex:`\TBCVS`2005.dll

To solve this problem try to recompile the toolkit on your machine and
then use the resulted ‘TBCVS2005.dll’ for your application.

Debugging OPC Toolkit core libraries in .NET based applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to debug the core binaries you have to switch ON the **Enable
unmanaged code debugging** option.

**The OPC server starts twice: first time started from the Windows
Explorer or Visual Studio and second time started by the client
application.**

This is a common DCOM problem caused by starting the server by different
users (one from the user and one from the system). In order to prevent
this, please configure the DCOM settings according to the `DCOM
Configuration article <6674f8ee-0d1c-484c-afdb-26d7231e089e.htm>`__

Registering an OPC Server fails.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Registration of an OPC server demands ‘Administrator’ rights.

Registering a Windows Service fails.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Registration of a Windows service demands ‘Administrator’ rights.

Connecting to a server that runs as service fails. The received error message is “Access denied”.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To solve the problem check your COM security settings. Read about
setting the right DCOM configuration in the `DCOM Configuration
article <6674f8ee-0d1c-484c-afdb-26d7231e089e.htm>`__.

Browsing the INAT server returns incorrect ItemIds.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When browsing the INAT server a special property must be set (.NET) / a
method must be called (C++) in order to have a correct browsing. It is
about the ForceBrowseUp property (.NET) / setForceBrowseUp() method
(C++). They must be set for an instance of the
AddressSpaceElementBrowseOptions class before the browsing is started.

Compiling a Microsoft Visual C++ Express Editions 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To solve this, follow the steps:

-  Install Microsoft Platform SDK on your computer

-  Configure your Visual C++ Express to include files from the “Include”
   directory of your newly installed Platform SDK. (Go to
   Tools->Options…->Project and Solutions->VC++ Directories. In the
   “Show Directories” comboBox select the “Include files” option. Create
   a new line that contains the path to the “Include” directory of your
   newly installed Platform SDK.)

-  Configure your Visual C++ Express to include files from the “Lib”
   directory of your newly installed Platform SDK. (Go to
   Tools->Options…->Project and Solutions->VC++ Directories. In the
   “Show Directories” comboBox select the “Library files” option. Create
   a new line that contains the path to the “Lib” directory of your
   newly installed Platfom SDK.)

-  Add to your project the “ole32.lib”, “user32.lib” and “advapi32.lib”
   as additional dependencies. (Go to Project Properties->Linker->Input.
   On the “Additional Dependencies” line add the
   “ole32.lib”,“user32.lib” and “advapi32.lib” libraries.)

Custom build step in server projects fails using VS2003 due to missing DLLs.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The server registration during the custom build step requires the
Softing Toolkit DLLs and if these DLLs are not available the start of
the server application will fail. These DLLs are available through the
$(PATH) variable of the Windows installation and are required during the
server registration. To solve this problem check the settings in your
Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 installation (Menu Tools - Options, select
Folder “Projects” and item “VC++ Directories” / “Directories for
executable files”) and add $(Path) to the list of variables. Later
Visual Studio versions (2005, 2008 and 2010) add $(Path) by default
during the installation to that list.

Custom build step in client projects fails due to linking errors.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It might look like this:

‘OpcClient.obj : error LNK2005: “private: static class
SoftingOPCToolboxClient::Application \*
SoftingOPCToolboxClient::Application::m_instance”
(?m_instance@Application@SoftingOPCToolboxClient@@0PAV12@A) already
defined in Console.obj’

The problem can be caused by the include of the header file
“ClientCommon.h” in another header file. “ClientCommon.h” is only meant
to be included in .cpp files where necessary. To solve this problem,
“ClientCommon.h” should be moved from the .h file to .cpp file.

Windows Vista / Windows 7 with UAC (User Access Control) enabled.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The registration and unregistration processes of an DCOM based OPC
server affects the registry database therefore someone may experience
difficulties on Windows Vista / Windows 7. When UAC is enabled OPC
server’s registration respective unregistration demands to be **Run As
Administrator** also by users with administrator rights.

The registration respective unregistration of an OPC server will be done
by running the application with /regserver respective /unregserver
argument. Usually in OPC generated projects registration is performed
via the project’s post build event. In Vista / 7 with UAC enabled this
will not work. There are two options to do the registration:

-  **A cmd file** - containing registration command *yourOPCServer.exe
   /regserver* started by means of Run As Administrator context menu.

   For a .net OPC project generated with the wizard, a
   *PostBuildEvent.bat* file is automatically generated at compilation.
   In this case this file can be used for Run As Administrator and no
   new batch file is necessary.

-  **runas batch command** - start the *yourOPCServer.exe /regserver* by
   means of the **runas** shell command

   E.g.: *runas /user:administrator
   “C::raw-latex:`\OPC`:raw-latex:`\yourOPCServer`.exe /regserver”*

Initializing the Toolkit with signed DLLs (TBN, TBC, OTB and other DLL/EXE files) takes longer than with unsigned binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The delay is related to the fact that the OS has to connect to the
internet several times in order to download a list of revoked
certificates. Related to `MSDN
article <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc656914.aspx>`__

The program can’t start because TB?VS20??.dll / OTB*.dll is missing from your computer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copying an application which uses Softing OPC Classic Toolkit from a PC
to another (or even from a folder to another on the same PC) requires
the user to also copy the required libraries - namely the Softing OPC
Classic Toolkit CORE (OTB*.dll) and the Softing OPC Classic Toolkit API
(TB?VS20?.dll).

The .NET application will not build any more after upgrading from Toolbox V4.3x to Toolkit V4.40
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with Softing OPC Toolkit version 4.40, the signature of many
.NET API function has changed (the data type of a single parameter).
Namely, the parameter corresponding to the object handle has changed its
data type from IntPtr to uint. This modification was required due to the
native 64-bit support added to the Softing OPC Toolkit.

Troubleshooting and FAQ

Why don`t the .NET Server Samples have the AnyCPU application configuration although the .NET API and the .NET Client Samples do have it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There seems to be an incompatibility problem between AnyCPU .NET OPC
Servers and Microsoft Windows DCOM. The problem is caused by the way the
AnyCPU applications start on x64 systems: when the AnyCPU OPC Server is
started (on a 64-bit operating system), a 32-bit process is initially
created; once the AnyCPU OPC Server detects that the OS supports 64-bit
processes, it just-in-time-switches to a 64-bit process. Windows DCOM is
not very happy with this fact (JIT 32-to-64-bit switching), as it loses
the reference (handle) to the 32-bit process and no communication will
take place between the OPC Client and the OPC Server (although the OPC
Server will correctly register with DCOM).

This problem will not occur if the AnyCPU OPC Server is run under a
32-bit OS.

The solution to this problem is to have the OPC Server be compiled as
native x64 application for 64-bit operating systems and as native x86
application for 32-bit operating systems.

The OPC Clients have no problem with the AnyCPU application
configuration as Windows DCOM is only instantiated after the process has
successfully started.

DaClient: removing many DaItems from a subscription causes performance loss
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a large number of items is to be removed, it is recommended to first
disconnect the subscription, remove the required items and then
reconnect the subscription. Depending on the OPC DA protocol used for
connecting to the OPC DA Server, if this recommendation is not followed,
the OPC DA Client built with Softing OPC Toolkit will: issue as many
individual “remove DA Item” calls to the OPC DA Server as items are
removed (if the OPC Client connects over OPCDA to the OPC
Server);disconnect the subscription, remove the respective DA Item and
reconnect the subscription as many times as items are removed from the
subscription (if the OPC Client connects over XMLDA to the OPC Server).

“missing afxres.h” while compiling Wizard-generated C++ projects or provided C++ samples (Visual Studio Express)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The C++ projects generated by Project Wizard along with the provided
client / server samples include the afxres.h header in their resource
files. This header is a part of the MFC Library and unfortunately
Microsoft Visual Studio Express editions do not contain MFC. If the
project doesn’t use MFC, afxres.h may be safely replaced with windows.h.

OPC Toolkit based applications running as Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The applications built with the Softing OPC Toolkit which have a Windows
Service architecture have the startup type implicitly set to manual.

.. _note-2:

Note
~~~~

::

   A different startup mode may be selected for the Windows Service-registered OPC Client/Server applications by 
   navigating to the Services Microsoft Management Console (Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Computer 
   Management -> Services and Applications -> Services).

It is not possible to set a service description to the Softing OPC
Toolkit based Client/Server applications which are designed to be

Error MSB3073: The command "copy ........:raw-latex:`\bi[...] `exited with code -1073741515.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The samples Softing OPC Classic Toolkit deploys copy the required
libraries for each build configuration every time the project is built.
Considering that Softing OPC Classic Toolkit can be installed in any
folder and also that “Program Files” folder naming differs according to
operating system (“Programme” on German Windows installations, “Program
Files (x86)” on 64-bit Windows installations), the paths to the required
libraries are relative.

.. _note-3:

Note
~~~~

::

   If the samples are copied/moved from the original Program Files Installation folder, it is solely the end user's 
   responsibility to adjust the project`s post-build events and manually copy the required binaries, if the case.

Softing OPC Classic Toolkit Project Wizard automatically adds full paths
to the generated projects since the Softing OPC Classic Toolkit is
already installed. Nevertheless, should a Softing OPC Classic Toolkit
installation be upgraded and the subsequent version installed elsewhere
than the previous version, all the previously Project Wizard-generated
projects need to be manually updated.

.. _note-4:

Note
~~~~

::

   The Softing OPC Classic Toolkit's "bin" folder is no longer added to System Environment Variables (under PATH) 
   from version 4.40 since different Visual Studios required binaries stored in different folders ("bin" or 
   "bin\Legacy").

Refreshing a connected subscription or an active subscription with no active items fails with 0x80004005 (E_FAIL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to the OPC DA Specifications V2.05a, the OPC DA Server
receiving an IOPCAsyncIO2::Refresh call for an inactive subscription
(group) or an active subscription (group) with no active items should
return the error E_FAIL to the caller OPC DA Client.

.. _note-5:

Note
~~~~

::

   It is not possible to refresh an inactive subscription or an active subscription with no active items.

Source code licenses are not upgraded when performing a Softing OPC Toolkit upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When installing a newer version of Softing OPC Toolkit, the newer source
code installers will no longer be deployed and installed since it may
cause incompatibility problems with previous source code or it may be
the case that customer-operated changes may be overwritten. It is
therefore necessary for the customer to manually perform the source code
license upgrade, by activating the purchased source code licenses again
in the License Manager application.

Access Denied when performing a Softing OPC Toolkit upgrade from 43x to 44x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When upgrading Softing OPC Toolkit from 43x to 44x, the new Toolkit will
use different DCOM values. The old (43x) Authentication Level and
Impersonation Level settings are None and respectively Impersonate, and
the new settings are Connect and respectively Identify. It is therefore
necessary for the customer to manually perform the DCOM values update,
should this be required. Please configure the DCOM settings according to
the `DCOM Configuration
article <6674f8ee-0d1c-484c-afdb-26d7231e089e.htm>`__. It is highly
recommended to use the new, more secure DCOM settings.

RPC_E_TOO_LATE (0x80010119 / -2147417831) error messages while initializing DCOM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Client/Server vendor should move the trace initialization BEFORE toolkit
application initialization to inspect these problems. If the error code
RPC_E_TOO_LATE appears each time CoInitializeSecurity is called, an
additional component (usually from .NET) initializes DCOM before Softing
OPC Toolkit is able to (as some simple, local COM object is required,
yet DCOM must be initialized before being able to use the COM object,
therefore DCOM is usually initialized by the respective component with
default system settings). Changing System-wide DCOM settings to the
required DCOM Settings (usually 43x settings - None / Impersonate -
again: this is not very secure) will result in the same errors being
traced but the Toolkit itself will work. Instead of doing that, vendor
should import CoInitializeEx and CoInitializeSecurity methods from OLE32
system library and call them on the first line of their application with
the required settings.

DCOM-related problems starting with Toolkit Classic V4.4x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with version 4.40 of the Softing OPC Classic Toolkit, the DCOM
settings have been upgraded to support very secure connections. By
default secure connections are enforced instead of unsecured
connections. The difference is in both OPCDA/OPCAE clients and servers,
in the initial CoInitializeSecurity call and also in the
IClientSecurity::QueryBlanket / SetBlanket security proxy blanket
negotiation.

The new DCOM settings used in the Softing OPC Classic Toolkit are
RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_CONNECT / RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IDENTIFY. These settings are
more secure and should be used instead of the pre-V4.40 legacy settings.
Please also follow the instructions in the `DCOM
Configuration <6674f8ee-0d1c-484c-afdb-26d7231e089e.htm>`__ to maximize
the security of the machine.

Softing OPC Classic Toolbox V4.3x and earlier employ legacy DCOM
settings - the RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_NONE / RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IDENTIFY are
used for both OPCDA/OPCAE Client and Server Applications. Although no
support is offered anymore for these settings, they are provided for
convenience reasons and might repair DCOM security incompatibility
between various remote OPCDA/AE Client and/or Server applications.
