**Step 1 - Generating the Application**
---------------------------------------

At the end of the tutorial, you will have created an Alarms and Events
Server with an event in the event space and an event source which can
initiate simple events.

This section describes how to generate an application by using the
`Project Wizard <c2dd4578-aa68-4ba7-bf5b-4da879baaa29.htm>`__ of the
Softing OPC Toolkit V4.4x.

First, you need to create a new project by selecting the “Project
Wizard” from the start menu folder “Programs \| Softing OPC Toolkit
V4.4x”. The Application Assistant shown in the figure below opens. On
the first page of the wizard select the Microsoft Windows operating
system.

Type the name of the OPC server project and the location where it should
be created. Note that the directory path must be a valid one. In case
the directory path doesn’t exist, a message error will block you from
going further.

Next the OPC specification must be chosen. We want to create an Alarms
and Events Server so please choose the OPC Alarms & Events
specification.

For the tutorial, we do not want the wizard to generate a server that
simulates events. In the next steps, we will see how to generate these
events.

After the Project Wizard has generated the source code, you have a
compilable, executable OPC Server. In the next steps we are going to see
how to create area and source spaces and how to generate events.
