## **OPC Core Componentss**

The OPC Clients and Servers built with Softing OPC Toolkit require the OPC Core Components in order to communicate with each other. The **OPC Core Components** represent the DCOM proxy/stub libraries and are needed by every OPC Client and Server as it is actually the code which marshalls/unmarshalls data across process/apartment/machine boundaries.

### Note
```
The **OPC Core Components** are not required by pure OPC XML-DA Clients and Servers.
```

It is mandatory to install the **OPC Core Components** on each machine where an OPC DA / OPC AE Client or Server are to be deployed.

The OPC Core Components also include the **OPC Enum** Windows Service which allows a remote (or local) OPC Client to enumerate the local OPC DA/AE Servers registered on the system.

### Note
```
If enumerating OPC Servers is also desired and the only deployed OPC Server-side Core Components is the 64-bit 
one, please also include the 32-bit OPC Core Components, as the OPCEnum service is only installed by the 32-bit 
version of the Core Components.
```

### Note
```
It is always recommended to install both x86 and x64 OPC Core Components.
```
The OPC Foundation provides the binaries needed by the OPC DA/AE Client and Server applications as Windows Installer packages. The required Windows MSI installers are provided in the **SOFTING\OPCToolkit\V44x\Redist** folder under the Program Files or installation directory.
