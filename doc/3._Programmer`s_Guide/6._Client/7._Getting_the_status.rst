**Getting the status**
----------------------

In the toolkit, the **DaSession** and **AeSession** objects exist for
getting information on the status of a Data Access respectively an
Alarms and Events server. The method is called **GetStatus** and it
returns to the client a **ServerStatus** object that contains
information about the server.

The following information about a server is returned:

-  Vendor information - Information about the server’s manufacturer

-  State - The current status of the server, i.e. running

-  Start time - The time when the server started

-  Current time - The time in the server when the method GetStatus was
   called

-  Supported locale Ids - The list with all the languages supported by
   the server

-  Last update time - The time when the last data was sent to the client
   by callback

-  Group count - The total number of subscriptions that clients have
   created in the server

-  Bandwidth - The processor performance consumed by the server

-  Status information - The text that describes the current server state

the **DAConsole** example. For a detailed example on how to get an
Alarms and Events server status, check the **AEConsole** example.
